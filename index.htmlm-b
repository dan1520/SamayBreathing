        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Beyond just breathing and being a breathwork instructor, there is something much deeper that connects us to ourselves. The noise around us and external distractions pull us away from our purpose and our true essence. 
        My journey with breathwork has profoundly transformed me, strengthening my intuition and allowing me to experience things that words cannot fully describe. 
        This website and everything I am building here are just a small part of what I want to share with you. 
        Our ancestral connection is more profound and significant than we often realize, and through breathwork, we can reconnect with that wisdom.</p>
