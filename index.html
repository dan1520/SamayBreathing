            <p>Hi, I'm Daniela, the creator of Samay Breathing.</p>
            <p>Breathwork is more than just a practice for me—it's a path to self-discovery, healing, and deep connection with ancestral wisdom. In a world full of distractions, our breath is a powerful tool that brings us back to ourselves, to our truth.</p>
            <p>My journey with breath has transformed me in ways I can't fully put into words. It has strengthened my intuition, deepened my awareness, and opened doors to experiences beyond explanation.</p>
            <p>This website is just the beginning—what I truly want to share goes far beyond these pages. It’s about reconnecting with something ancient and sacred, something that has always been within us.</p>
